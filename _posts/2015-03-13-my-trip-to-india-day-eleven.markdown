The final day of my trip to India, after being away from home for almost two weeks, I am ready to be back home. The day started out with me waking up earlier than I usually would, but with more sleep than I would usually get. Going backwards after being on IST actually is helping my sleep pattern resemble something normal... can't wait to ruin it by staying up late playing video games.

After buying a new tube pass, and an hour / hour and a half long ride back to the airport, moving through security was a breeze. Though I was the only one of the group to get the extended pat down by security thanks to the RFID blocking stuff in my passport tripping up the metal detector. Even better, the bar/pub/restaurant we (and by we I mean the folks at Perk) always eat at in London, Hoxleys, was right next to our security line for some easy access to food and booze. Well, food and coke for me, my coworkers handle the booze drinking part of that visit.

After a few hours of waiting, we jumped on the plane where I am currently writing this, to head back home to Austin. While on the plane, myself and two of my coworkers decided to setup an AdHoc network and play Minecraft for a couple of hours which was pretty fun, even though a flight attendant asked us if we "had ever kissed a girl". You may be thinking, "well thats rather rude isn't it?", but we thought it was hilarious, especially since the two of them are married.

Overall this trip has been a blast, and I plan to write a wrap up/overview/my thoughts about the whole experience after I get home and have a moment to decompress from all the flying and unpacking. I'm very grateful that I was able to experience this, and hope I get to do so again in the future, but if not, than at least I can say I've done it once.

For everyone who has read along, and commented saying they've enjoyed reading, I really appreciate it. My hope is to get better and better at writing the more I write for this blog, and this trip seemed like a great place to start.
