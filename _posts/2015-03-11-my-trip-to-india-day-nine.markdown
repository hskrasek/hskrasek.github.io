Just a heads up, this is going to be a quick little post, but today was my last day in India. We woke up early so we could get to the office and get some work done before we left. I wish I could say I was super productive, but dealing with blockers slowing me down prevented that from happening; I'll make it up back home though. After spending what felt longer than a week with the team in Bangalore, and getting to meet everyone, it sucked to say goodbye.

After leaving the office we headed back to Orion mall for some last minute shopping, and some team bowling. Fun fact: I suck at bowling! Like really badly. Only way I could have won those games is if we played by golf rules. But it was still a ton of fun, and a nice little way to finish up our time in India.

Well, I finished packing to the best of my ability, and need to head to bed after posting this. Flight leaves at 7am IST in the morning, which means we need to leave the hotel at 3am IST. Let me tell you, super excited about the lack of sleep in my future, but the 23 hour layover in London will be fun. I still can't believe that I had the chance to fly half way across the world and experience Bangalore, I can't thank Perk enough for giving me the opportunity. Alright, off to bed I go!
