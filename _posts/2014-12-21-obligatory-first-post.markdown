I have never considered myself to be that great of a writer, but after reading articles from [Chris Fidao][fideloper] and [Phil Sturgeon](sturgeon), I decided I would revamp my personal site and try my hand at writing with my own blog.

Most of my articles will be about my experiences with programming and work, but every once in a while I might write about personal matters if I am inspired enough.
