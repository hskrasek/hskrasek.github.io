Did you know that this site is hosted on [Github](https://github.com)? Well you do now! Due to this blog being hosted on Github, you can actually contribute to the blog. Sadly, this doesn't mean you can guest write posts, but if you find factual or grammatical errors you'd like to fix, you'll be able to help.

# How can you contribute?

First you'll need to fork the repository for this site to make changes of your own to the blog posts or pages.

<!-- Code sample of forking the repo here -->

After you've made your changes and committed them, visit Github and open a Pull-Request against my repository, and explain in the description what you've fixed. If I approve the changes, and I probably will, the pull request will be closed and the changes will be pushed up to my website. Oh and I'll add your name to the list of contributors on this page and the README for the repository as a show of thanks.
