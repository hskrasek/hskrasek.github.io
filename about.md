I'm an Austin based web developer that started programming in PHP when I was 14. When I first started programming in PHP it was all spaghetti code, and I wasn't even aware Object Oriented Programming was a thing, since I was self taught. Fast forward eight years and I have learned a couple of things, such as MVC, OOP, Version Control, Agile, and more. After graduating from St. Edwards University this May (2014), I started working on RESTful API's, and it's become my new favorite thing to do. 

I love working with new technologies, and finding new and clever ways to improve the quality and architecture of my code. Which is great, because [Perk.com](http://perk.com) allows me to do just that while building the API's to power our numerous mobile apps.
